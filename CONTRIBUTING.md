# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for contributing! Before you contribute, we ask some things of you:

- Please follow our Code of Conduct, the Contributor Covenant. You can find a copy [in this repository](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) or under https://www.contributor-covenant.org/
- All Contributors must agree to [a CLA](.github/CLA/INDIVIDUAL.md). When opening a PR, the system will guide you through the process. However, if you contribute on behalf of a legal entity, we ask of you to agree to [a different CLA](.github/CLA/ENTITY.md). In that case, please contact us.

## Development Setup

1. Install Rust 1.91.0 or later via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs/openvtc.git
   cd openvtc
   ```
3. Build the workspace:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
4. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace
   ```

### Optional: Hardware Token Support

To build without OpenPGP card support (avoids PC/SC dependencies):

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features
```

## Code Standards

### Formatting and Linting

All code must pass formatting and linting checks before merge:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

### Commit Messages

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- All commits must be DCO-signed (`git commit -s`)

### Branch Naming

- `feat/<short-description>` — New features
- `fix/<short-description>` — Bug fixes
- `docs/<short-description>` — Documentation only
- `refactor/<short-description>` — Code refactoring

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and branch** from `development` (or `main` for hotfixes)
2. **Write tests** for new functionality — PRs that decrease test coverage will be flagged
3. **Run the full check suite** locally before submitting:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all --check
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
   cargo test --workspace
   ```
4. **Open the PR** with a clear title and description summarizing the change
5. **Link related issues** using `Closes #123` or `Fixes #123` in the PR body
6. **Respond to review feedback** promptly

## Architecture Overview

The workspace is organized as a layered architecture:

- **`openvtc-lib`** — Core library: cryptography, DID management, configuration, protocol logic. No UI dependencies.
- **`openvtc-cli`** / **`openvtc-cli2`** — CLI/TUI binaries that consume `openvtc-lib`
- **`openvtc-service`** — Background messaging daemon
- **`did-git-sign`** — Standalone git signing proxy (intentionally independent from `openvtc-lib`)
- **`robotic-maintainers`** — Automated VRC issuance service

Key design principles:
- Crypto and protocol logic stays in `openvtc-lib` — binary crates are pure consumers
- Secrets are handled with `secrecy`/`zeroize` — never log, serialize, or expose key material
- Error handling uses `thiserror` in the library and `anyhow` in binaries

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow the [Security Policy](SECURITY.md). Do **not** open a public issue.

When writing code that handles sensitive data:
- Use `SecretString` / `SecretVec` for secret values
- Ensure secrets are zeroized on drop
- Never include secret material in error messages or logs
- Use `OsRng` (not `thread_rng()`) for cryptographic randomness
